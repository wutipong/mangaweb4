# MangaWeb 4 Frontend

## Configurations

**MangaWeb 4** can be configured using environment variables. Below is the default values.

```sh
BACKEND_URL=localhost:8972
DEFAULT_SORT_FIELD=CREATION_TIME # can be either 'NAME', 'PAGECOUNT', or 'CREATION_TIME'
DEFAULT_ORDER=DESCENDING # can be either 'ASCENDING' or 'DESCENDING'
```

**MangaWeb 4** also supports reading environment variables from `.env` file at run time.

## Authentication

By default, **MangaWeb 4** use Cloudflare Access's `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` request header value to identify the user.

If the request is made without this parameter, the default user (default@example.com) will be used instead. Also if this header is set with an email address that's not exists in the system, a new account will be created automatically.

### OpenID Connect Authentication

**MangaWeb 4** also support OpenID Connect provider as the authentication source. **MangaWeb 4** has been tested with [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/)'s implicit flow. Other kind of provider might or might not work. Feel free to open an issue if you have problems setting up your OIDC provider of choice.

In order to use OIDC Provider as the authentication source, update the following environment variable.

```sh
OIDC_ENABLE=true
OIDC_CLIENT=<Client ID>
OIDC_SECRET=<Secret>
OIDC_AUTHORIZE=<Authorize URL>
OIDC_TOKEN=<Token URL>
OIDC_ISSUER=<OpenID Configuration Issuer>
OIDC_JWKS=<JWKS URL>
OIDC_LOGOUT=<Logout URL>
```

## Development

**MangaWeb 4** was developed with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en) runtime. Currently other runtimes such as [Bun](https://bun.com/) are not supported.

### Running MangaWeb 4

Before you can run **MangaWeb 4**, you have to install its dependency first. Use `npm install` command to install the dependencies.

After that, use the command `npm run dev -- --open` to start the server in development environment.

For more information, please consult [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) documentation.

### Setup gRPC code generation.

**MangaWeb 4** use gRPC to communicate between the frontend service and backend service. The gRPC toolchain is required, please use the instruction from the [protobuf website](https://protobuf.dev/installation/) to install.

Then, setup the schema submodule using the following command.

```sh
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

And lastly, run `npm run generate-grpc` to generate gRPC code.

The grpc's schema files are kept separately in [mangaweb4-grpc-schema](https://github.com/mangaweb4/mangaweb4-grpc-schema) repository. If you need to update the `*.proto` file, make sure to commit the change back to the repository and then update the code on the backend side, otherwise the code between the two components might be out-of-sync and can cause communication issue.

### Generating Web Application Manifest resources

**MangaWeb 4** includes progressive web application (PWA)'s web application manifest resources so it could run as a standalone application despite being a web application.

In order to update the PWA's icon, make changes to the file `static/favicon.svg` and then run the script `npm run generate-pwa-assets` to update other icons.

**MangaWeb 4** uses [Vite PWA Plugin](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) to setup PWA.
